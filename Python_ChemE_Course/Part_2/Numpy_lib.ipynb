    "#### Numpy Library \n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy is a python library that allows you to build multidimensional arrays.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some array attributes \n",
    " Attribute | returns | Description\n",
    " --------- | ------- | ----------- \n",
    " ndarray.ndim | int | number of dimensions\n",
    " ndarray.shape | tuple | number of elements in each dimension\n",
    " ndarray.size | int | number of elements\n",
    " ndarray.dtype | dtype | data type of elements \n",
    "\n",
    "*np.array* is a function that returns ndarray object. \n",
    "\n",
    " We can use Numpy for math functions : \n",
    " - We can use all sorts of trigonometric functions.\n",
    " - We can use exponential and logarithmic functions. \n",
    " - We also have some mathematical constants. \n",
    "\n",
    "To import them we either use : \n",
    " - import math\n",
    " - from numpy import cos, sin, pi, nan\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Array Creation \n",
    "Functions to create arrays : \n",
    " Function | Description\n",
    " -------- | ---------- \n",
    " np.zeros | Array filled with zeros\n",
    " np.ones(shape) | Array filled with ones\n",
    " np.eye(dimension) | This produces the identity matrix\n",
    " np.arange(start, stop, step) | creates a one dimensional array\n",
    " np.linspace(start, stop, quantity) | Creates a one dimensional array \n",
    " np.vstack([arrays]) and hstack([arrays]) | adds elements from one or more arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods for resizing arrays: \n",
    " Method | Description\n",
    " ------ | -----------\n",
    " reshape(new_shape) | returns an array with a specific shape\n",
    " resize(new_shape) | Modifies the shape of the array being applied\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: Pay attention to which methods modify the array and which returns new array. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Basic operations with arrays \n",
    "The arraus in numpy have many functionalities of which they can behave like data structures such as vectors or matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the basic operations and how do arrays behave : \n",
    "- Arrays accepts basic operations +, -, *, / and executes them element wise, so arrays must be exactly the same shame \n",
    "- Arrays also accept operations with a number (int, float).\n",
    "- Boolean operations are also accepted and returns an array filled with booleans. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Numpy  Memory management\n",
    "*Remember that the nuloy array is not dynamic also, be careful with objects when copying, manipulating and pasting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To copy an array we use the *.copy()* method. this makes a copy of the array.\n",
    "**Note that the equal sign does not execute this function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Property\n",
    "**.base** : returns the base array that was used to create the current array.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note***: We can use the logical operater \"is\" to checl if we have a new object. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Statistical methods for arrays \n",
    "\n",
    " Method | Description\n",
    " ------ | -----------\n",
    " max(axis=None) | Returns the maximum value\n",
    " min(axis=None) | Returns the minumum value\n",
    " argmax(axis=None) | Returns the index of the maximum value\n",
    " argmin(axis=None) | Returns the index of the minimum value\n",
    " sum(axis=None) | Returns the sum of the array elements\n",
    " cumsum(axis=None) | Returns an array with the cumulative sum of the elements\n",
    " prod(axis=None) | Returns the product of the array elements \n",
    " cumprod(axis=None) | Returns an array with the cumulative product of the elements\n",
    " mean(axis=None) | Returns the mean of the array elements\n",
    " var(axis=None) | Returns the Variance of the elements\n",
    " std(axis=None) | Returns the standard deviation of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: when the axis option is used, the operation will be performed along the specified axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Array indexing and slicing\n",
    "\n",
    " Operation | Description\n",
    " --------- | -----------\n",
    " [i] | For one dimensional arrays, it works similar to lists\n",
    " [:i] | Displays an array from index 0 until i-1\n",
    " [i:] | Displays an array from element i until the last\n",
    " [::i] | Displays all the elements varying from i to i\n",
    " [::-i] | Displaysthe sequence from back to front of the elements between i and i\n",
    " [a:b:c] | start, end , step\n",
    " [i,j] | To display an element of a matrix\n",
    " [i,a:b] | Returns a slice of row i with elements from a to b\n",
    " [n,i,j] | Dimension, Row, Column \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Matrices in Numpy \n",
