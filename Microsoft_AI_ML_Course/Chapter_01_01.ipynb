    "- Application insights\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data sources and pipelines, frameworks and platforms: \n",
    " having valid working ML models starts with mastering data pipelines, model development frameworks and deployment platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is a Data Pipeline?\n",
    "- It is a series of processees that automate the flow of data from one point to another. Transforming it along the way to prepare it for analysis or Machine learning applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key components are : \n",
    "- Data sources.\n",
    "- Data inkestion tools.\n",
    "- Data transformation processees and data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model development frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tools that help build, train and evaluate ML models. These include **TensorFlow, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn and Azure ML SDK**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Each framework has it's own strengths*.\n",
    "- TensorFlow and Pytorch are ideal for deeplearning models or models that require the use of neural networks.\n",
    "- Scikit-Learn is a go-to for traditional models and user friendly applications.\n",
    "- Azure ML SDK is very powerful when integrated with Azure environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flexiblity to choose the right framework is ***Crucial***. As it allows you to optimize the development process and the model final performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Deployment platforms \n",
    "\n",
    "Once developed and trained, the next step is to deploy the Machine learning model. \n",
    "for deployement we use either ***Azure kubernetes services (AKS) or Azure Machine Learning services***.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AKS** is ideal for deploying models at scale, allowing containerizing models and deploying it along a cluster of virtual machines. Providing high availability as well as scalability. \n",
    "- ***Azure Machine Learnin Services*** it simplifies the deployment bu allowing to deploy Machine learning models as web services. It supports automated Machine Learning and Model management.\n",
    "- *** Azure app services*** helps deploy the model as part of a web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction into data sources and pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "A data source is any origin of data you will ultimately use in a Machine learning project. Either structured or non-structured data. \n",
    "\n",
    "***What exactly is a data pipeline ?*** \n",
    "It is a set of automated processees that take raw data from sources, clean it, transform it. And ultimately deliver it to it's destination.\n",
    "The purpose of the pipelines is to ensure that your data is accurate, consistent and ready for analysis or modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "***A typical pipeline involves several Key components***\n",
    "- Data injestion.\n",
    "- Data processing and transformation\n",
    "- Loading into a data storage system\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note*** Azure DataBrick is great for collaborative work and handling data analytics at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to model development approaches and framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Model development is the process of creating algorithms that can learn from data, make prediction and derive decisions.\n",
    "##### Model development\n",
    "This step involves several key stages : \n",
    "- Begins with selecting the right algorithms.\n",
    "Training the model using data, adjusting parameters and tuning hyperparameters to improve performance. \n",
    "- Evaluation to see accuracy and if the model generalizes well to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "***What are the tools that help us with this process ?*** ==> Model development frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model development frameworks\n",
    "These are software libraries that provide the building blocks for creative Machine learning models including pre-Built algorithm utilities for data processing and tools for model evaluation and deployment.\n",
    "The most popular tools are ***TensorFLow, Pytorch, Scikit-Learn and Azure Ml SDK***\n",
    "\n",
    "***Key considerations for selecting a framework are***: \n",
    "- Project requirement and objectives.\n",
    "- Ease of use.\n",
    "- Deployment capabilities.\n",
    "- Cost efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What to examine in Project requirement and objectives**\n",
    "- ***Nature of the problem*** determines whether your project invloves deeplearning, traditional ML or other specialized areas such as reinforcement learning or natural Language processing. \n",
    "- ***Data types and sizes***: Consider the type and volume of the data you'll be working with. Large-scale data sets and complex data types, such as images and videos. May require more powerful frameworks with GPU/TPU support.\n",
    "- ***Performance requirement***: Assess whether the project requires real time predictions. High accuracy, or scalable deployment. Different frameworks excel in different areas, so understanding your performance needs is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction to deployment platforms\n",
    "This means taking a Machine learning model and making it ready for use in real world environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common deploymeny services are : \n",
    "- Azure kubernetes services (AKS)\n",
    "- Azure app services\n",
    "- Azure functions\n"
