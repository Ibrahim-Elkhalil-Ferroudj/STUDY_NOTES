    "# Data Acquisition techniques \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sources of data \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. DataBases\n",
    "These are the backbone of data collection and storage. Databases are structured systems where data is organized to tables making it easy to query, update or manage. Work with relational databases will be required such as SQL, My SQL. These are extremely helpful where data integrity and consistency is required such as finance or healthcare. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Web scraping \n",
    "This involves extracting data from websites, usually through automated scripts. This is useful when you need to gather unstructured data. However, this methoed comes with it's own drawbacks, such as hige amounts of data cleaninf and preprocessing and perhaps terms of service. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. APIs \n",
    "***Application Programming Interface***, these allow you to programmatically access data and services provided by other applications. For example retrieve weather conditions in real time or social media posts or access financial market data. One of the key benefits is that they often return data in a structured format such as **JSON** or **XML** formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. External Data sets\n",
    "These are datasets that are publicly abailable or provided by 3rd party. These are valuable to train your model or perform data analysis on a broader scale. They are often used to supplement existing data or provide context to your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools for data acquisition\n",
    "Among the various techniques and tools available for data acquisition, **Structured Query Language (SQL)** stands out as one of the most powerful and commonly used. SQL is the backbone of data retreival and management in relational databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL allows you to perform a variety of operations on the data stored within the databases such querying, updating, inserting and deleting records. SQL is essential for extracting meaningful ingormation from large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key components of SQL \n",
    "- **SELECT** Statement : This is the most fundemental operation in SQL. It's used to query the data base and retreive specific data based on defined criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers WHERE country = 'united states';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SELECT** statement is versatile and can be combined with other SQL clauses to filter, sort and aggregate data. Making it a powerful tool for data acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **WHERE** clause: This clause is used to filter records based on specific conditions. It helps narrow down the data returned by the query. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2025-01-01';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Join operations \n",
    "the ***JOIN*** operations is usedto combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. it's crucial for working with normalized databases where related data is stored in separate tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of JOIN\n",
    "- **INNER JOIN** : This returns only the records that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "- **LEFT JOIN(or LEFT OUTER JOIN)** : This returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If no match found **NULL** Values are returned for columns from the right table. \n",
    "- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)** : This returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table.\n",
    "- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)** : This returns all the matched records from either the left or right records. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT customers.first_name, customers.last_name, orders.order_id\n",
    "FROM customers\n",
    "INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GROUP BY and aggregation functions\n",
    "- **GROUP BY**:  The GROUP BY clause groups rows that share the same values in specified columns into summary rows, often used with aggregation functions, such as ***COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MIN() and MAX()***.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT product_id, COUNT(*) AS total_sale\n",
    "FROM sales\n",
    "GROUP BY product_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **ORDER BY** : This clause is used to sort the result set of a query either by one or more columns, either in an ascending `(ASC)` or descending `(DESC)` order. \n",
    "***Example***:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers\n",
    "ORDER BY last_name ASC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements \n",
    "- **INSERT** : adds new records to a table.\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "INSERT INTO customers (first_name, last_name, email)\n",
    "VALUES ('JOHN', 'DOE', 'John.doe@gmail.com');\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **UPDATE** : Modifies existing records in a Table. \n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "UPDATE customers\n",
    "SET email = 'new.email@gmail.com' WHERE customer_id = 123;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **DELETE** : Removes records from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 123;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced SQL concepts \n",
    "- **Subqueries and Nested queries** : This allows for more complex data retreival.\n",
    "***Example***: \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customers\n",
    "WHERE customers_id IN (SELECT customers_id FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2025-01-01')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing** : Indexes are used to speed up the retreival of rows by using a pointer. Creating an index on a column means the database will keep a sorted copy of that column which allows for faster search and querry operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Example***:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON customers(customers_id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note*** : It's important to use indexing judiciously, as it can also increase the time it takes to write new data to the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Transactions and ACID properties\n",
    "***Definition*** : A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations trated in a single unit. **ACID** properites ***(Atomicity, consistency, Isolation and Durability)*** ensure that these transactions are performed reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Example*** : \n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "BEGIN Transaction\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance -100 WHERE account_id = 1:\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance +100 WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",

    "    print('request successful')\n",
    "else : \n",
    "    print('request failed')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 3 : Parse the HTML content\n",
    "```python\n",
    "soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n",
    "\n",
    "#print the title of the webpage to verify\n",
    "print(soup.title.text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Step 4 : Extract the data you need.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#find the table containing the data\n",
    "table = soup.find('table', {'id': 'data-table'}) # replace 'data-table' with the actual td of the table or class\n",
    "\n",

    "for row in rows : \n",
    "    cols = row.find_all('td')\n",
    "    cols = [cols.text.strip() for col in cols]\n",
    "    data.append(cols)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert the data into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns = ['Column 1', 'Column 2', 'Column 3'])\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Step 5 : Save the scraped data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Saving it into a CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "df.to_csv('Scraped_data.csv', index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling common scraping challenges\n",
    "- a. Handling missing data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in rows[1:] : \n",
    "    cols = row.find_all('td')\n",
    "    if len cols ==3:  # ensuring all data columns are present\n",

    "        data.append([product_name, price, rating])\n",
    "    else :\n",
    "        print('Skipping a row with missing data')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- b. Adding delay between requests\n",
    "`time.sleep(2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- c. Handling dynamic content\n",
    "Some websites load content dynamically using `Javascript` which can't be directly scraped with `BeautifulSoup`. In such cases, you might need to use `Selenium`, a web driver that can interact with `Javascript` driven content\n",
    "\n",
    "- d. Error handling\n",
