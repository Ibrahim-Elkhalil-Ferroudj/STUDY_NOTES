    "# This is notes from the refinning hanbook\n",
    "\n",
    "Every refinery has it's own refining capacity either expressed in ***BPSD*** or ***BPCD***\n",
    "- ***BPSD*** : \"Barrels Per a Stream Day\" this means  how many barrels at a day fully operational (No down time)\n",
    "- ***BPSCD*** : \"Barrels Per Calendar Day\" this means how many barrels per normal streaming capacity (no down time)\n",
    "BPSD > BPCD\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification of refinning operations\n",
    "There are 4 types : \n",
    "- **Distillation** : Atmospheric and vaccum columns to separate the crude into groups of hydrocarbon compounds based on size and boiling point range.\n",
    "- **Conversion Processes**: These are to change the size and structure of hydrocarbon molecules by : \n",
    " 1. Decmposition : Through cracking and similar processes\n",
    " 2. Unification : Alkylation, Polymerisation\n",
    " 3. Reforming : Isomerisation, Catalytic reforming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Treatment processes**: Prepare Hydrocarbon strams for additional processes and to prepare finished products using chemical and physical separations \"Desalting, hydrodesulfurization, solvant refinning, sweetening, solvant extraction and dewaxing\"\n",
    "- **Blending**: The process of mixing and combining Hydrocarbon fractions, additives to produce finished products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important charachterization properties\n",
    "*SpGr*, *%S*, *TAN* these are the most important properties in charachterizing crude oil.\n",
    "- **SpGr*: Specific gravity is the density of the crude and is measure in °API. The higher the °API the lower the desnity ($\\frac{Kg}{\\text{m}^3}$) $\\rightarrow$ paraffinic $\\rightarrow$ and give high proportion yields of gasoline and light petroleum products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *%S*: This represents the sulfure percentage. Sulfure is an undesirable impurity because of pollution and corrosion concerns. it is measure in $\\text{wt\\%}$ \n",
    "$$\\uparrow \\text{s\\%} \\rightarrow sour$$ and also $$\\downarrow \\text{s\\%} \\rightarrow sweet$$\n",
    "and the crossover is at (1.5% - 0.5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *TAN*: Total Acid number, this measure the potential of corrosivity. It quantifies the milligrams of potassium hydroxxide needed to neutalize 1g of crude. therefore it is expressed in : $$TAN: \\frac{mg(KOH)}{g(Crude)}$$\n",
    "Corrosive if TAN > 1 $\\frac{mg(KOH)}{g(Crude)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of refineries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple : Atmospheric distillation, catalytic reforming and one or more pretreatment facilities and hydrodesulfurization unit.\n",
    "- Complex : Vaccum distillation, catalytic reforming and catalytic cracking.\n",
    "- More Complex : Includes coking processes\n",
    "\n",
    "The refinning process is an energy intensive process, where 35-40% of the energy is used in by the atmospheric and vaccum distillation. and as most refinery streams, hydrotreating is necessary which takes around 20%.\n",
