    "# This is notes from the refinning hanbook\n",
    "\n",
    "Every refinery has it's own refining capacity either expressed in ***BPSD*** or ***BPCD***\n",
    "- ***BPSD*** : \"Barrels Per a Stream Day\" this means  how many barrels at a day fully operational (No down time)\n",
    "- ***BPSCD*** : \"Barrels Per Calendar Day\" this means how many barrels per normal streaming capacity (no down time)\n",
    "BPSD > BPCD\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification of refinning operations\n",
    "There are 4 types : \n",
    "- **Distillation** : Atmospheric and vaccum columns to separate the crude into groups of hydrocarbon compounds based on size and boiling point range.\n",
    "- **Conversion Processes**: These are to change the size and structure of hydrocarbon molecules by : \n",
    " 1. Decmposition : Through cracking and similar processes\n",
    " 2. Unification : Alkylation, Polymerisation\n",
    " 3. Reforming : Isomerisation, Catalytic reforming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Treatment processes**: Prepare Hydrocarbon strams for additional processes and to prepare finished products using chemical and physical separations \"Desalting, hydrodesulfurization, solvant refinning, sweetening, solvant extraction and dewaxing\"\n",
    "- **Blending**: The process of mixing and combining Hydrocarbon fractions, additives to produce finished products.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important charachterization properties\n",
    "*SpGr*, *%S*, *TAN* these are the most important properties in charachterizing crude oil.\n",
    "- **SpGr*: Specific gravity is the density of the crude and is measure in °API. The higher the °API the lower the desnity ($\\frac{Kg}{\\text{m}^3}$) $\\rightarrow$ paraffinic $\\rightarrow$ and give high proportion yields of gasoline and light petroleum products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *%S*: This represents the sulfure percentage. Sulfure is an undesirable impurity because of pollution and corrosion concerns. it is measure in $\\text{wt\\%}$ \n",
    "$$\\uparrow \\text{s\\%} \\rightarrow sour$$ and also $$\\downarrow \\text{s\\%} \\rightarrow sweet$$\n",
    "and the crossover is at (1.5% - 0.5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "- *TAN*: Total Acid number, this measure the potential of corrosivity. It quantifies the milligrams of potassium hydroxxide needed to neutalize 1g of crude. therefore it is expressed in : $$TAN: \\frac{mg(KOH)}{g(Crude)}$$\n",
    "Corrosive if TAN > 1 $\\frac{mg(KOH)}{g(Crude)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of refineries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple : Atmospheric distillation, catalytic reforming and one or more pretreatment facilities and hydrodesulfurization unit.\n",
    "- Complex : Vaccum distillation, catalytic reforming and catalytic cracking.\n",
    "- More Complex : Includes coking processes\n",
    "\n",
    "The refinning process is an energy intensive process, where 35-40% of the energy is used in by the atmospheric and vaccum distillation. and as most refinery streams, hydrotreating is necessary which takes around 20%.\n",

    "### Refinning products\n",
    "- C1: is usually used as refinery fuel. but can be used as feedstock for hydrogen production by pyrolitic cracking and reaction with steam.\n",
    "- C2 : Is also used as refinery fuel, or as feedstock for hydrogen and ethylene production. these two are recovered as refinery waste and sold to petrochemical plants.\n",
    "- C3 : Used as refinery fuel, but can also be sold as LPG (Liquified petroleum gas). Propyléne is often seperated for the production of polypropyléne.\n",
    "- C4 : Is also used as refinery fuel. But also as component of LNG.\n",
    " - nC4 : Has lower TVR than iC4, that's why it's added to gasoline to regulate the TVR. It has a blending octane of 90 (It's a low cost octane enhancer) and it is also used as a feedstock of iC4 production.\n",
    " - iC4: It has it's greatest value when used as a feedstock in alkylation units, where it reacts with unsaturated materials to form higher octane number iso-paraffin compounds in the gasoline boiling range.\n",
    "Their main source is catalytic cracking and hydrocraking units.\n",
    "iC4 can be used for alkylation or sold as LPG or can be reacted with methanol to produce (ETBE \"Ethyl Tertiary butyle ether\")\n",

    "### Properties of crude oil\n",
    "#### API gravity\n",
    "A measure of density and related to SpGr : $$\\text{°API} = \\frac{141.5}{SpGr} - 131.5$$\n",
    "$10 \\leq °API \\leq 50$  (Could be over 50)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flash point \n",
    "The temperature at which the vapor above the oil will momentarily flash or explopde\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Octane number \n",
    "This is a measure of a gosoline's engine resistance to knock or detonation in a cylinder of the engine.\n",
    "By definition, the octane number is a percentage of iso-octane in a blend of iso-octane and n-heptane.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Viscosity\n",
    "Is the measure of an oil resistance to it's internal flow, and is an indication to the oil lubricating qualities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Could and pour points\n",
    "The are tests that indicate the relative coagelation of wax in the oil (indication of the paraffinity or aromaticity of the oil)\n",
    "$$\\downarrow \\text{pour point} \\downarrow \\text{paraffinic content}  \\uparrow \\text{aromatic content} $$\n",

    "- Thiophenes : C4H4S\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Carbon Residu\n",
    "Carbon residu is determined by distillation to coke in the absence of air. It's roughly related to the asphalt content and the lubricating oil fraction that can be recovered. The lower the carbon residu teh more valuable the crude.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Salt content\n",
    "If the salt content of crude is greater than 10lb/1000bbl. Generally it is necessary to desalt the crude before treatment, otherwise severe corrosion problems maybe encountered\n",
    "$$ \\frac{10lb}{1000bbl} \\rightarrow 3PPM $$\n",

    "- Kw (Kuop) rand from less than 10 for highly aromatic materials to almost 15 for highly paraffinic materials.\n",
    "- CI index is useful for evaluating individual fractions of crude oils. It's based on straight chain paraffines having CI value of 0 and benzene having CI index value of 100\n"
