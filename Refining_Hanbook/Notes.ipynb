    "## Classification of refinning operations\n",
    "There are 4 types : \n",
    "- **Distillation** : Atmospheric and vaccum columns to separate the crude into groups of hydrocarbon compounds based on size and boiling point range.\n",
    "- **Conversion Processes**: These are to change the size and structure of hydrocarbon molecules by : \n",
    " 1. Decmposition : Through cracking and similar processes\n",
    " 2. Unification : Alkylation, Polymerisation\n",
    " 3. Reforming : Isomerisation, Catalytic reforming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Treatment processes**: Prepare Hydrocarbon strams for additional processes and to prepare finished products using chemical and physical separations \"Desalting, hydrodesulfurization, solvant refinning, sweetening, solvant extraction and dewaxing\"\n",

    "- Complex : Vaccum distillation, catalytic reforming and catalytic cracking.\n",
    "- More Complex : Includes coking processes\n",
    "\n",
    "The refinning process is an energy intensive process, where 35-40% of the energy is used in by the atmospheric and vaccum distillation. and as most refinery streams, hydrotreating is necessary which takes around 20%.\n",

    "Higher efficiencies and lower costs are obtained of the crude oils separation is accomplished in two steps : \n",

    "### Crude desalting \n",
    "\n",
    "If salt content is greater than 3 PPM (NaCl) $\\rightarrow $ desalting is necessary to minimize fouling and corrosion caused by salt deposition on heat transfer surfaces and acides formed by decomposition of chloride salts.\n",
    "Some metals in inorganic compounds dissolved with water emulsified with crude oil which can lead to catalyst deactivation are also rejected in the desalting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The salt in the crude is in the form of dissolved or suspended salt crystals in water emulsified with the crude oil which leads to problems that occur in : \n",
    "- Obtaining efficient and economical water/oil mixing.\n",
    "- Water wetting of suspended solids.\n",
    "- Separation of the wash water from the oil\n",
    "\n",
    "The separation ease and efficiency are affected by : ***Ph, gravity, viscosity and the volume % of wash water used per volume of crude***.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Some aspects***: \n",
    "- Efficient and economic water/oil mix (3-10% water at 90-150°C)\n",
    "- Wetting agents (oxyalkylated, Alkylphenols)\n",
    "- Separation (Chemical agents or current)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atmospheric topping unit\n",
    "After desalting, the crude oil is pumped through a series of heat exchangers and it's temperature is raised to 288°C by heat exchange with products and reflux streams. Then it's further heated to 399°C in a frunace and charged to the flash zone of the atmospheric distillation tower.\n",
    "The furnace discharge temperature is sufficiently high to cause vaporization of all products withdrawn above the flash zone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vaccum distillation\n",
    "The temperature required for the heavier fractions at atmospheric pressures are so high that thermal cracking would occur before they are distilled. That's why we use a vaccum because with a drop in pressure the boiling temperature also drop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of steam improve voprization to the furnace inlet at the bottom of the vaccum tower (also minimizing coke formation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective pressure at the flash zone determine the fraction of feed vaporized at a given outlet temperature. That's why the ***Fractionation tower, overheadlines and condesor*** are designed to minimize the pressure drop between the vaccum inducing device and the flash zone. \n",
    "The **Pressure drop** can significantly increase in the volume of the vapor per barrel vaporized, that's why vaccum distillation colymnns are larger in diameter than atmospheric ones (can reach up to 12.5m) \n",
    "\n",
    "### The light end units\n",
    "The light end plant transforms the ful range naphta to the refinery's volatile and light oil products. It contains : \n",
    "- The de_butanizer\n",
    "- The de-propanizer\n",
    "- The de-ethanizer\n",
    "- The naphta splitter\n",
    "\n",
    "### Catalytic reforming\n",
    "Catalytic reforming is a process where light petroleum distillates (naphta) are contacted with a platinum containing catalyst at elevated temperature and elevated hydrigen pressure for the purpose of raising their octane number.\n",
    "The reformate stream can either be used as high octane gasoline blending component or as a source of aromatics. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Reforming reactions***:\n",
    "- Aromatization through dehydrogenation of naphtenes\n",
    "- Cyclization and dehydrogenation of paraffines to the analogue aromatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Octane numbers*** of hydrocarbons as hydrocarbon mixtures are determined by comparing their anti-Knock properties to various blends of n-heptane(0), 2,2-4 trimethyl pentane (Iso-octane, 100)\n",
    "Hydrocarbons may apprear to have different octane when blended with other mixtures, this is called *Blending Octane*.\n",
    "In the reforming reactions, the catalyst used (Platinum and alumina) are bifunctional whereas separate and distinct reactions occur on the platinum side than the alumina.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platinum side typically performs dehydrogenation and hydrogenation whereas on the acidic alumina side cyclization, isomerization and cracking are performed.\n",
    "Paraffin isomerization is the most difficult step in reforming, so the ability to convert paraffin selectivey is of paramount importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another acidic catalyized reaction isthe cracking of paraffins into light products. Thus improving octane number by turning them into light gaseous low molecular weight paraffins.\n",
    "Paraffins can also be cyclized into naphtenes, this reaction can be realized through an olefinic intermediate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of reactions\n",
    "***Hydrogenation, dehydrocyclyzation, isomerization and hydrocracking*** : \n",
    "- Saturated olefines with already paraffines are isomerized and to some extent converted to naphtenes and then subsequently converted into aromatics.\n",
    "- Naphtenes directly converted to aromatics through dehydrogenation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note*** : The reforming reaction is endothermic so we must introduce heat to the mixture before entering each reactor\n",
    "\n",
    "***Reactions leading to undesirable products*** : \n",
    "- Dealkylation of side chains on naphtenes and aromatics forming butane and light end paraffins\n",
    "- Cracking of paraffines and naphtenes to form butane and lighter paraffines"
